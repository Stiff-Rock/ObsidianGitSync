## Getting Started

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: First, sign up for a GitHub account (if you don't have one) and create a new repository. Whether the repository is public or private is up to you; the plugin should work with either way.
2. **Add Your Repository**: Enter your GitHub repository URL in `Settings > Obsidian Git Sync`.
3. **Set Up Authentication**: 
   - For HTTPS, use a Personal Access Token and ensure you enter your GitHub username.
   - For SSH, make sure SSH authentication is configured both in GitHub and on your computer.
4. **Sync Your Vault**: Commit, push, pull, or enable auto-commit for automatic syncing.

## Future Plans

- **Mobile Version**: I am planning to create a mobile version, but it will be a slow development process since I work on this as a hobby in my free time. Stay tuned for updates!
